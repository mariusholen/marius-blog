Welcome to my new developer blog!

This space will serve as a personal lab — a place where I explore ideas, try out new tools and techniques, and document what I learn along the way. My main focus will be on React and .NET, but the blog will naturally grow with whatever catches my interest at the moment.

### Why Astro?

I chose Astro for this blog because it strikes a nice balance between performance, flexibility, and developer experience. It gives me static-site speed, clean HTML output, and lets me bring in React (or other frameworks) only where I actually need interactivity.

It also feels like a great way to experiment with new frontend ideas, without committing to a single stack across the whole project.

### Project Structure

One thing I’m experimenting with here is keeping styling modular and scoped. Each component or layout gets its own `.css` file, sitting alongside the component file itself. This keeps things tidy and makes it easier to reason about styles in isolation.

As I build more features, I’ll likely refine this setup — but for now, it feels like a good balance between structure and flexibility.

I plan to evolve the blog itself as part of the journey, refining the design, improving features, and experimenting as I go. New posts will come alongside those changes, reflecting both what I’m building and what I’m learning.

Thanks for stopping by — and feel free to follow along as this space takes shape!
